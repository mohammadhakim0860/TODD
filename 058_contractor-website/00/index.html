          <h1 class="art-h1">LEARN ABOUT RADON</h1>
          <h2 class="art-h2">Radon is a cancer-causing, radioactive gas</h2>
          <p class="art-p">
            You can't see radon. You can't smell radon. You can't taste radon.
            But radon may be a problem in your home. Radon causes thousands of
            deaths each year. The Surgeon General has warned that radon is the
            second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. Only
            smoking causes more lung cancer deaths.
          </p>
          <h2 class="art-h2">Radon can be found all over the U.S.</h2>
          <p class="art-p">
            Radon comes from the natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in
            soil, rock, and water and gets into the air you breathe. Radon can
            be found all over the U.S. and can get into any type of building â€”
            homes, offices, and schools. You and your family are most likely to
            get your greatest exposure at home, where you spend most of your
            time.
          </p>
          <h2 class="art-h2">You should test for radon</h2>
          <p class="art-p">
            Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk
            from radon. The EPA and the Surgeon General recommend testing all
            homes. Testing is inexpensive and easy. It will only take a few
            minutes of your time.

          <h2 class="art-h2">You can fix a radon problem</h2>
          <p class="art-p">
            Radon reduction systems work and they are not too costly. Some radon
            reduction systems can reduce radon levels in your home by up to 99%.
            Even very high levels can be reduced to acceptable levels.
          </p>
          <h2 class="art-h2">How does radon get into your home?</h2>
          <p class="art-p">
            Radon is a radioactive gas. It comes from the natural decay of
            uranium that is found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up
            through the ground and into your home through cracks and other holes
            in the foundation. Your home traps radon inside where it can build
            up. Any home may have a radon problem. This means new and old homes,
            well-sealed and drafty homes, and homes with or without basements.

            Nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is estimated to have
            elevated radon levels. Elevated levels of radon gas have been found
            in homes in Fresno, Clovis, surrounding San Joaquin Valley homes,
            and in homes in the Sierra Mountains. While radon problems may be
            more common in some areas, any home may have a problem. The only way
            to know about your home is to test.

          <h2 class="art-h2">
            The EPA And the Surgeon General recommend testing for radon
          </h2>
          <p class="art-p">
            Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk
            from radon. Testing is inexpensive and easy. The EPA and the Surgeon
            General recommend that you test your home for radon. Millions of

          <h2 class="art-h2">The testing process</h2>
          <p class="art-p">
            Testing your home for radon is easy. Simply call us and book an
            appointment. The appointment will take place at your house. One of
            our technicians will come to your home and install testing
            equipment. The equipment is small and quiet. The equipment will be
            placed in an unobtrusive location. Setting up the equipment only
            takes a few minutes. After two days, our technician will come back
            to your house, pick up the equipment, interpret your results, answer
            questions, and provide solutions.

          <h2 class="art-h2">Testing fees</h2>
          <p class="art-p">
            Testing your home for radon is very affordable. The fee for testing
            is normally $250 but we are offering a special promotion through the
            end of the month which offers testing for only $99.

          <h2 class="art-h2">Radon measurement</h2>
          <p class="art-p">
            Radon is measured in picocuries per liter (pCi/L). If your radon
            level is 4 pCi/L or higher, the EPA and the Surgeon General
            recommend that you fix your home. Radon levels less than 4 pCi/L
            still poses a risk which, in many cases, may be reduced. The EPA
            believes that any radon exposure carries risk - no level of radon is
            safe. Even radon levels below 4 pCi/L pose some risk, and you can
            reduce your risk of lung cancer by lowering your radon level.
          </p>
          <p class="art-p">
            The average indoor radon level is estimated to be about 1.3 pCi/L.
            About 0.4 pCi/L of radon is normally found in the outside air. The
            U.S. Congress has set a long-term goal that indoor radon levels be
            no more than outdoor levels. While this goal is not yet achievable
            in all cases, most homes today can be reduced to 2 pCi/L or below.

            More home buyers and renters are asking about radon levels before

            there is often little time to deal with radon and other issues. The
            best thing to do is to test for radon now and save the results so

          <p class="art-p">
            There is no known safe level of radon. You can reduce your risk by
            decreasing radon levels in your home.
          </p>
          <p class="art-p">
            There are several proven methods to reduce radon in your home. The
            method primarily used is a vent pipe and fan, which pulls radon from
            beneath the house and vents it to the outside. This system, known as
            a soil suction radon reduction system, does not require major
            changes to your home. Sealing foundation cracks and other openings
            makes this kind of system more effective and cost-efficient. Similar
            systems can be installed in houses with crawl spaces. Our licensed
            contractors might use other methods. The right system depends on the
            design of your home.
          </p>
          <p class="art-p">
            Lowering high radon levels requires technical knowledge and special
            skills. Our contractors are licensed and trained to fix radon
            problems. We will study the radon problem in your home and find the
            best solution for lowering radon levels in your home.
          </p>
          <p class="art-p">
            After we have installed a system for lowering radon levels in your
            home, we will test your home again to ensure that radon levels have
            been reduced to a safe level. Our soil suction radon reduction
            systems also include a monitor that will indicate whether the system
            is operating properly.

          <p class="art-p">
            If you are planning a remodel, it is important to test the area for
            radon before you begin. If you have elevated radon levels,
            radon-resistant techniques can be inexpensively included as part of
            the remodel. Because major renovations can change the level of radon
            in any home, always test again after work is completed. Contact us
            so that we may help you make your home a safe and healthy place to

          <p class="art-p">
            We are a local, family-run business. We began this business because
            we became aware of the cancer-causing hazard that radon poses. After
            our son was born, I learned that children are particularly
            susceptible to the negative health impacts of radon. At the time
            there was no local business that provided radon testing or
            mitigation. In order to keep our family safe, we educated ourselves.
            We learned how to test for radon and how to reduce radon levels. The
            first radon mitigation system we installed was in our home. I am
            happy that our home is now free from the unnecessary danger of
            hazardously high radon levels.

            Helping people stay safe, helping people protect their families, and
            helping people avoid cancer is what our business is all about. As we
            talked to friends and family about radon, we realized there are many
            people who can benefit from what we have learned. We partnered with
            our cousin who is a licensed general contractor and our business was
            born.

            enjoy their lives.
